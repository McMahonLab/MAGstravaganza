# MAGstravaganza
Investigation of how freshwater nutrient cycling is linked at the organism level.

The goal of this analysis is to determine pathway presence/absence in genomes assembled from metagenomes (MAGs) in two lakes with very different environmental conditions.
We hypothesize that the pathways present in genomes will reflect the functioning of the ecosystem where those genomes belong.

Repo Structure
------------------------------
/MAGstravaganza						We propose that the name for a group of MAGs is a MAGstravaganza, like a gaggle of geese or a congress of owls
- README.md						This file
- Code/							Scripts used in analysis of the MAGs. The "MAGstravaganza_manuscript_plots" files will be most interesting, as these are the analysis presented in the manuscript.
- Manuscript_drafts/					See the evolution of the manuscript!
- time_series_mapping/					Results and preliminary analysis of mapping the time series metagenomes to the MAGs
- dbCAN_results/					Output of annotating CAZy enzymes in the MAGs, one file per MAG
- Mansucript_plots/					Intermediate and file versions of plots in the mansucript
- Pathway_analysis					Data sheets and results used for calculating pathway presence/absence
- Supplemental/						Supplemental files accompanying the manuscript
