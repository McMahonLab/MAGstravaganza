# MAGstravaganza
We propose that the name for a group of MAGs (metagenome-assembled genomes) is a MAGstravaganza, like a gaggle of geese or a congress of owls. Using time-series metagenomes and time-series resolved MAGs from three different freshwater environments, we analyze predicted functions and how these function co-occur in genomes. This reveals how carbon and nutrient cycles are connected by microbes in freshwater.

- Code/							Scripts used in analysis of the MAGs. The "MAGstravaganza_manuscript_plots" files will be most interesting, as these are the analysis presented in the manuscript.
- Manuscript_drafts/					See the evolution of the manuscript!
- time_series_mapping/					Results and preliminary analysis of mapping the time series metagenomes to the MAGs
- dbCAN_results/					Output of annotating CAZy enzymes in the MAGs, one file per MAG
- Mansucript_plots/					Intermediate and file versions of plots in the mansucript
