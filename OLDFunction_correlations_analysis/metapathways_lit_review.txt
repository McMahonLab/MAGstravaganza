LIT REVIEW
05/18/2016

After running exploratory_analyses.Rmd, I found that I do not have the necessary power to test my original hypothesis.
The issues are:
- Not enough pathways identified
- Incomplete genomes makes confirming absence of pathways nearly impossible
- Epilimnia have lower diversity of pathways than hypolimnia
- Huge numbers of pairwise comparisons

I next tried cluster analysis via ordination. I found that genomes did not cluster by lake. There were two dispersed clusters of pathways, but I couldn't tell why they were different.

My goal for today is to do a lit review and see if anyone else has run MetaPathways on MAGS, or if there are any ideas for using MetaPathways that I haven't encountered before.
I'm starting my search at Web of Science, looking at papers that have cited the MetaPathways publications.

Metagenomics of Pavilon Lake
- could make venn diagrams of pathways shared and unique in sampling sites
- could analyze differences in pathway content by phylogeny

Chris' coalbed paper
- identify weird pathways and focus on those
- Group organisms by important pathways (aromatic degradation, fermentation, cellulose degradation)

The other papers I've found deal with only metagenomes (not MAGs) or genomes of cultured isolates. 

It seems like publishing 270 genomes with pathway predictions and interpretations of what those pathways mean ecologically would be a nice paper.
Are there any pathways or groups of pathways in the identification table that stick out to me?
- lots of amino acid biosynthesis/degradation
- chitin degradataion
- sulfur and nitrogen cycling
- vitamin biosynthesis/degradation
- ethanol, methyloglyoxal, glycerol , ethanolamine degradation
- methanogenesis/methylotrophy
- photosynthesis
- carbon/nitrogen fixation
- cellulose/vanillin degradation
- cyanophycin
- aromatic compound degradation
- and of course, central metabolism - things like respiration, fermentation, reductive TCA

Plan of action:
- Take only pathways that are 50% complete
- Manually go through them and add a category designation (for example, central metabolism, cellulose degradation, sulfur reduction)
- For each genome and lake, condense down to # of pathways in each category
Note: need to look up the lakes of the genomes not in the metadata file
